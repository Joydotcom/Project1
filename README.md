<!-- # Project1

As a user I want to use an app that will help me plan my day by suggesting an activity and food suggestions based on my location so that I can experience something new. 

Tired of trying to find a movie or new show to watch? Go Day Trippin'! With our app, we'll find not only an activity for you to do, but we'll also give you suggestions on where to do the activity, and plan the rest of your day with the top rated restaurants near you! In the end you'll have a a personalized itinerary based on your location!
